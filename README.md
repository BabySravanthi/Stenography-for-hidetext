# Stenography-for-hidetext

This code allows users to hide a text message within an image using a secret key and then retrieve it. Here's an explanation and the full code:

Explanation:
      Importing Libraries:
              The code uses OpenCV (cv2) for image processing and hashlib for generating secure hashes.
      Creating Dictionaries: 
              Two dictionaries are created for character-to-integer and integer-to-character mappings for the extended ASCII set.
      Reading the Image: 
              The image is read using OpenCV and its dimensions are stored.
      Input Security Key and Text:
              The user is prompted to input a security key and the text to hide.
      Encoding Process: 
              The text is encoded into the image using the key. Each character of the text is XORed with each character of the key, and the result is stored in the image's pixel values.
      Saving the Encoded Image: 
              The modified image is saved.
      Decoding Process: 
              The user is prompted to input the key to retrieve the hidden text. The key is verified and the text is decoded from the image.

Steps to Use the Code:
      Install OpenCV: 
              Ensure you have OpenCV installed.
                  pip install opencv-python
      Run the Script:
              Save the code in a Python file, e.g., steganography_with_key.py.
      Provide Input:
              Enter the path to your image file.
              Enter the security key.
              Enter the text message to hide.
      Decode the Message:
              Enter 1 to unhide the text.
              Enter the security key to retrieve the hidden message.
Important Note:
      Ensure the image path is correct and the image is in a readable format for OpenCV. The code uses the XOR operation for both encoding and decoding, ensuring the process is reversible with the correct key.
